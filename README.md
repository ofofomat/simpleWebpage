# simpleWebpage
This is a training series of videos in youtube called "How to Make a Webiste with HTML, CSS, Javascript from Scratch Beginner Tutorial" from Brian Design

In the very beggining I thought of following every step exactly as he did, but I made few changes to make the site look more like something I'd build.
If you watch his video, you'll be able to find the differences. They're somehow quite visable.

### The Hero Section

This is the first thing you'll notice in the page. It's the hero section. The CTA has a effect of changing color that builds up from the left to the right.
Clicking i=on it will open up the modal form.
The name of the company, the main header and sub title are my creation. Also, clicking in the meet us button on the navbar also leads to the same popup as the CTA.
This and the fact that the navbar's fixed were changes I did on the project.

### The Modal Form

The modal form was by far the longest to get done.
Again, the text and images I changed to match "my company". Also, the original video uses red in oposition to the blue I chose to bring contrast to the actual site.
When you do not fill correctly the fields and send the form anyways, error messages appear:

Also, if passwords do not match, the following will be displayed:

When hovering over the button, it turns red.
Clicking in the X or anywhere outside the modal will close it.

### The Gallery

Gallery's title, also rewritten to adapt to my context. Same goes for the images.

By default, that's how it looks like. Quite like a honeycomb. It should have a "reflective" effect that I could not reproduce, probably due to inexperience.

When hovering over, the hexagon grows and stands out from the rest.
Clicking on any image opens'em and a image slider.

Supposedly when clicking on button or another the images should change. Due to another error I could not find, the other images just don't appear.

### The Footer

A simple footer. Text and color slighted changed to better fit "my company".
